# 🛰️ Drone Data Collection for High-Precision Mapping

Welcome to this beginner-friendly guide and repository for drone-based data collection using **RTK (Real-Time Kinematic)** and **PPK (Post-Processed Kinematic)** methods. This project is focused on helping researchers, field scientists, and drone enthusiasts understand and implement accurate data collection workflows for photogrammetry and geospatial analysis.

## 📌 What This Repo Covers

- ✅ Basics of RTK and PPK  
- ✅ Equipment setup and best practices  
- ✅ RTK/PPK workflow guides  
- ✅ Agisoft Metashape integration  
- ✅ GCP (Ground Control Point) handling tips  
- ✅ Common pitfalls and troubleshooting  


## ❗ Troubleshooting Tips

- 📡 **RTK fix lost during flight?** Check signal quality and base connection.  
- 📍 **GCPs not aligning in Agisoft?** Double-check coordinate systems and accuracy level.  
- 📁 **Base station not referenced?** Apply post-survey correction using known geodetic coordinates.
