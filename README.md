# Smart Vegetation Mapping Workshop

## Introduction

Welcome to the Smart Vegetation Mapping Workshop repository. This workshop covers essential techniques in vegetation mapping using UAV-based multispectral and RGB data, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL). Participants will gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing, labeling, model training, and visualisation.

## Workshop Overview

This repository provides:

- Guides and scripts for preprocessing UAV multispectral and RGB data.
- Techniques for manual and semi-automatic labeling.
- Model training workflows using classical ML and DL approaches.
- Mapping and visualisation methods for vegetation analysis.
