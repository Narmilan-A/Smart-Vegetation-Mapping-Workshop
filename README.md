# Smart Vegetation Mapping Workshop

## Introduction

Welcome to the Smart Vegetation Mapping Workshop repository. This workshop covers essential techniques in vegetation mapping using UAV-based multispectral and RGB data, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL). Participants will gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing, labeling, model training, and visualization.

## Workshop Overview

This repository provides:

- Guides and scripts for preprocessing UAV multispectral and RGB data.
- Techniques for manual and semi-automatic labeling.
- Model training workflows using classical ML and DL approaches.
- Mapping and visualisation methods for vegetation analysis.

## Key Topics

### Preprocessing UAV Data
Learn how to process UAV imagery using Agisoft Metashape Pro and georeference datasets.

### Labelling Techniques
Explore ground truthing, region-of-interest extraction, and semi-automatic labeling methods.

### Model Training
Implement classical ML and DL models on different platforms, including local machines, Google Colab, and high-performance computing (HPC).

### Working with Own Data
Apply learned techniques on personal datasets for customized vegetation mapping.

### Mapping and Visualisation
Generate predictions and visualise results using geospatial tools.

## Repository Contents

```
