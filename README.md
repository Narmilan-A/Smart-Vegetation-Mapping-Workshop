### **Preprocessing UAV RGB and Multispectral Data**
- Introduction to Agisoft Metashape Pro for image processing and orthomosaicing.
- Techniques for processing UAV RGB and multispectral imagery.
- Georeferencing images using QGIS for accurate spatial alignment.

### **Labelling Techniques**
- Understanding the importance of ground truth information for data accuracy.
- Manual and semi-automatic labelling methods to prepare training datasets.
- Extracting regions of interest and preparing labelled masks for machine learning.

### **Model Training (Classical ML and DL) – Part I**
- Introduction to machine learning and deep learning models for vegetation mapping.
- Working with local computers, Google Colab, and high-performance computing resources.
- Introduction to GitHub repositories and folder structures for version control.

### **Model Training (Classical ML and DL) – Part II**
- Detailed script explanations for model training and testing.
- Techniques for training, evaluating, and fine-tuning models using classical machine learning and deep learning methods.

### **Mapping and Visualisation**
- Making model predictions and integrating them into visualization tools.
- Advanced visualization techniques for interpreting model results and generating vegetation maps.

## Workshop Details
The workshop will cover a wide range of topics, from data preprocessing to model training and visualization, enabling you to confidently apply these techniques to real-world vegetation mapping challenges.
